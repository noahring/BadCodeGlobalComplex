## BadCodeGlobalComplex

### What is wrong with it?
We intentionally poorly formatted, uncommented, and disorganized code to break every rule we could from the book. Variable names are non descriptive, very poor indentation, no comments, mehtods and classes are not descriptive. This code is very hard to read and understand and dare we say that there is now ay you can understand what is going on in the code. This is a good example on why we need to use the best practices laid out in the book or else your code could look like this. This is GlobalComplex's submission for the Bad Code Competition.
